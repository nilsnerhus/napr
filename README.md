# napr
This package is a collection of all National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the United Nations Framwork Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC). 

At the moment, it is under development. The end goal is:

- A crawler that automatically fetches NAPs from the UNFCCC-website
- A function that reads the PDFs into R
- A simple script to group the texts together with a predictable name

The inspiration for this package is from the introductory guides to text analysis
